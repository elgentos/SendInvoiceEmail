# elgentos SendInvoiceEmail

This small extension allows to send out invoice emails for payment methods that do not do this themselves, like PayPal Express and Authorize.net.

It allows you to configure this in Sales > Sales Emails > Invoice.

Not choosing an option here does not mean the invoices will not be sent; this is merely used to force sending an invoice email when it hasn't been mailed yet.
